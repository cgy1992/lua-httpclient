# httpclient
`httpclient` is a unified wrapper around a few common http/s libraries and methods.

The use case for this was being able to use an internal Github API client via openresty/`ngx.location.capture` and also outside of openresty using `luasocket` and `luasec`.

The `luasocket.http` API is a bit different than the ngx api. This provides a "familiar" interface to both.

*NOTE*: the wrappers for `ngx.location.capture` and `lua-resty-http` modules are not yet done. "Release early/release often" or something like that...

## Usage
You can look at the tests for various usage examples but most interactions use a common pattern.
The result of any call will be a table with the following structure:

```lua
{
  body = <response body>,
  code = <http status code>,
  headers = <table of headers>,
  status_line = <the http status message>,
  err = <nil or error message>
}
```

### Get
```lua
hc = require('httpclient').new()
res = hc:get('http://httpbin.org/get')
if res.body then
  print(res.body)
else
  print(res.err)
end
-- {
--   "args": {}, 
--   "headers": {
--     "Accept": "*/*", 
--     "Connect-Time": "1", 
--     "Connection": "close", 
--     "Host": "httpbin.org", 
--     "Total-Route-Time": "0", 
--     "User-Agent": "LuaSocket 3.0-rc1", 
--     "Via": "1.1 vegur", 
--     "X-Request-Id": "b64c0bb9-653a-44ec-8bd2-a768ad80d720"
--   }, 
--   "origin": "1.1.1.1", 
--   "url": "http://httpbin.org/get"
-- }
```

### Post
```lua
hc = require('httpclient').new()
res = hc:post('http://httpbin.org/post','somepostdata')
```

The following verbs are supported:
- `GET`
- `PUT`
- `POST`
- `HEAD`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`

Note that this library does not do any special handling of the response body other than giving it to you as-is.
This library is intended to be used by a higher-level library that handles parsing

As other drivers are finished out, they'll be passed in to the constructor. Currently the default driver is `httpclient.luasocket_driver`

## Other bits
There are ways to override much of what you pass in to the actual http request specific to the driver.

## Requirements
The following versions were tested
- lua 5.2 (the version that shipped with trusty)
- luasec 0.5-2 (only required for https support)
- luasocket 3.0rc1-1

If you want to run the test suite:
- luacov 0.6-1
luaunit is included in the test dir

## TODO
- Add remaining drivers
- make a rockspec/post to luarocks
- Document better
